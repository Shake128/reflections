When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    Whenever having a backup can be useful, but mostly for cooperation with others.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

   Because you might not be satisfied with your work yet, or you could be testing 
   highly experimental features that you don't want updated on the repository,
   also because you might be working on your own on somebody else's project with
   no cooperation involved. these are just a few.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    forks are copies of a repository on your git account. they let you modify 
    someoneâ€™s work without ever interfering with his/her repository.
    Clones are local copies of an online repository, you can use these to work 
    locally or offline on a project. Branches are ramifications of the 
    development that diverge from the master branch. they are used to test new 
    features or experimental ones.
